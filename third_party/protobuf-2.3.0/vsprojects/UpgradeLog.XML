This includes new and improved functions, additional checking and validation, and internal design changes. These libraries are turned on by default. You may see some warnings about unsafe functions or parameters when you build your project. The warnings will generally suggest an alternative safer coding style or function. It is advised that you correct these warnings, in order to make your code more safe. Full details can be found in the documentation by searching for 'Security Enhancements in the CRT' and for 'Checked Iterators'.">

These changes may cause existing code to no longer compile without changes to the code or the compiler options with which it is built.">

You may need to change your build in order for it to work correctly. For instance, it is recommended that the dependency information contained in any manifest files be converted to &quot;#pragma comment(linker,&quot;&lt;insert dependency here&gt;&quot;)&quot; in a header file that is included from your source code.  If your project already embeds a manifest in the RT_MANIFEST resource section through a resource (.rc) file, the line may need to be commented out before the project will build correctly.">
</Event><Event ErrorLevel="1" Project="gtest" Source="..\gtest\msvc\gtest.vcproj" Description="Due to a conformance change in the C++ compiler, code change may be required before your project will build without errors.  Previous versions of the C++ compiler allowed specification of member function pointers by member function name (e.g. MemberFunctionName).  The C++ standard requires a fully qualified name with the use of the address-of operator (e.g. &amp;ClassName::MemberFunctionName).  If your project contains forms or controls used in the Windows Forms Designer, you may have to change code in InitializeComponent because the designer generated code used the non-conformant syntax in delegate construction (used in event handlers).">
